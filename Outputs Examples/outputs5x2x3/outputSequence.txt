In inflated maze (original scaled by 2):
sequence of 22 steps from (4, 2, 4) to (0, 0, 0)
sequence is: [(4, 2, 4), (5, 2, 4), (6, 2, 4), (7, 2, 4), (8, 2, 4), (8, 2, 3), (8, 2, 2), (8, 2, 1), (8, 2, 0), (7, 2, 0), (6, 2, 0), (5, 2, 0), (4, 2, 0), (3, 2, 0), (2, 2, 0), (2, 2, 1), (2, 2, 2), (2, 1, 2), (2, 0, 2), (2, 0, 1), (2, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0)]

Althought, in original deflated maze:
sequence of 11 steps from (2, 1, 2) to (0, 0, 0)
sequence is: [(2, 1, 2), (3, 1, 2), (4, 1, 2), (4, 1, 1), (4, 1, 0), (3, 1, 0), (2, 1, 0), (1, 1, 0), (1, 1, 1), (1, 0, 1), (1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0)]
